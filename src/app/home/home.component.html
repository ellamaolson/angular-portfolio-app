  <h2>Hi, I'm Elana!</h2>
  <p>
    I'm 23 years old and am a graduating senior at San Jose State University, getting my degree in
    Software Engineering. I love cooking and experimenting with recipes, knitting scarves
    for my family and friends, exploring the world, and adventuring in the outdoors.

    My journey into software engineering began when I was 10. I joined the techbridge club
    where I learned about STEM and built cool projects like my own home phone. I eagerly joined
    the Engineering program at my high school and learned even more about various technical
    careers. Entering college, I thought I was going to become a civil engineer, but soon
    realized I wanted a job where I could actually build something from start to finish in a 
    relatively short period of time. I moved into a "hacker house" where I lived with 11 
    software engineers who let me inquire into their daily routines at work and why they had chosen
    software. This is where I decided to pursue software engineering. Five years later, three 
    software internships, and an slightly greater understanding of adulthood, I have become 
    a software engineer!

      So this is really where my journey begins. I love coding and working with engineers. I 
      am one of those strange people who actually enjoys meetings because it is an opportunity 
      for me to collaborate with another engineer. Engineers value the scientific process of 
      researching, implementing, testing, and refining. They want to find the practical solution
      in an efficient manner, churning out new ideas and real products within a short timeframe. 
      Engineers not only help move the gears of a larger machine/company, they design and build 
      the gears! So my goal is to become a gear - helping to move forward a great mission.
